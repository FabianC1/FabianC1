# 👋 Hi there, I’m Fabian Galasel (@FabianC1)

🎓 I'm a recent BSc (Hons) Computer Science graduate from Middlesex University, passionate about solving real-world problems through software.

💻 I enjoy working across the stack — from building intuitive front-end interfaces to designing scalable back-end systems.  
🔍 I'm especially interested in web development, mobile apps, game development, and edtech solutions.

🌱 Currently learning: TypeScript, React Native, and AWS fundamentals.  
📂 Working on: Uploading and documenting all of my university and personal projects (websites, games, mobile apps, software tools).  
🤝 Open to: Graduate software development roles and collaborative side projects.
